Project motivations:
The Pet Adoption Dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of pet adoption from shelters. With an increasing number of pets in need of homes, it's crucial to identify the factors that influence adoption rates. This project aims to analyze the dataset to uncover insights that can help improve adoption strategies and outcomes.
To identify influential factors in pet adoption using the Pet Adoption Dataset, several data analysis techniques can be employed, for instance: Clustering techniques, classification , summary statistics,and data visualisation, by applying these techniques, we can gain an overall understanding of the factors influencing pet adoption, enabling shelters and organizations to implement data-driven strategies to enhance their efforts.
