Project motivations:
The Pet Adoption Dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of pet adoption from shelters. With an increasing number of pets in need of homes, it's crucial to identify the factors that influence adoption rates. This project aims to analyze the dataset to uncover insights that can help improve adoption strategies and outcomes.
To identify influential factors in pet adoption , several data analysis techniques can be employed, for instance: Clustering techniques, classification , summary statistics,and data visualisation.

We decided to work on this dataset to contribute to a culture of compassion and responsibility towards animals in our communities. By leveraging data-driven insights, we can create a more informed approach to pet adoption, fostering a positive change in the lives of countless animals and their future families. Also to provide actionable insights that shelters can implement to enhance their adoption strategies, such as targeted marketing or specialized care for certain breeds.
